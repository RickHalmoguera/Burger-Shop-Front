## Overview
Welcome to Burger Shop's online platform! This website, developed using HTML, Sass, and following the BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology, offers users a seamless experience for booking tables at the restaurant. In this version, you will only find the UI. The next steps include integration with an API to manage reservations in a dashboard made with React.
